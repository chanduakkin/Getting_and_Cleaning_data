# Getting_and_Cleaning_data
This repo contains the Project submission for Coursera Course of Getting and Cleansing Data

# Course Project

(find all project-related materials in the UCI HAR Dataset directory, however, copies of the important files have been put into this main directory to fulfill the submission requirement)

    Unzip the source (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) into a folder on your local drive, say <Path to Download>

    Put run_analysis.R into <Path to Download>/UCI HAR Dataset

    In RStudio: setwd("<Path to Download>/UCI HAR Dataset"), followed by: source("run_analysis.R")

    Use data <- read.table("tidy_ds_with_the_averages.txt") to read the data. There are 30 subjects and 6 activities, thus 30 * 6 = 180 rows.
